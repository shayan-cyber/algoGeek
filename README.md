 To fully understand how the backend and front end of a website works, I decided to code something that I personally like a lot: An online coding contest hosting website with features like ranking system, leaderboard, discussion room, practice problems, contests And code editor that supports more than one language. The journey to get here was tough, but I believe I have learnt many valuable lessons along the way.
